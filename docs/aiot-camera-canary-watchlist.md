# AIoT Camera Canary Watchlist

## Purpose

This watchlist is for the Home Device Domain cutover day. It keeps camera
journeys observable without widening into IM transport or HarborOS system
control.

This round is VLM-first for the Harbor Assistant device page: image, snapshot,
still-frame, and local DVR segment inputs are first-version surfaces. Continuous
video is stored as low-bitrate rolling segments and indexed through keyframe
sidecars, not through a DVR-specific model chain.

Release-v1 adds local DVR capture as media artifacts, but the device lane must
continue to express it through the existing recording policy, camera profile,
and Harbor Assistant DVR settings records rather than a new use-case profile object.

## Devices & AIoT Admin Summary

- Ownership: the Home Device Domain owns `camera.scan`, `camera.connect`,
  `camera.snapshot`, `camera.share_link` (`camera.live_view` stays a
  compatibility alias), `device.inspect`, and `device.control`.
- Watchlist: discovery stays normalized, connect continues through
  `needs_input` and `resume_token`, snapshot stays media-only, share output
  stays a signed link artifact, inspect stays read-only, and control stays
  device-native.
- DVR watch: release-v1 surfaces segment length, retention, stream kind, and
  keyframe hints; Harbor Assistant continues to use the existing recording policy,
  camera profile records, and DVR settings.
- Non-regression: `route_key` stays opaque routing metadata, `resume_token`
  stays business-flow continuation, camera control never becomes HarborOS
  system control, and retrieval/control separation stays explicit.

## In Scope

- device discovery and scan validation
- camera connect continuation through `needs_input` and `resume_token`
- explicit coverage for `discover`, `snapshot`, `share_link`, `inspect`, and
  `control` while staying inside the device domain
- snapshot, live view share (`camera.share_link`, with `camera.live_view` accepted as a compatibility alias), and analyze flows where the current codebase supports them
- image, snapshot, still-frame, and local DVR segment inputs are the first-version VLM surface for Harbor Assistant; video understanding uses keyframe sidecars
- media/control separation in the device runtime
- legacy fallback when `route_key` is absent

## Camera Journey Canary

1. `camera.scan`
   - expected signal: camera candidates are discovered and normalized
   - watch fields: `device_id`, `discovery_source`, `ip_address`, `rtsp_paths`
2. `camera.connect`
   - expected signal: a device can be added or continued after password prompt
   - watch fields: `requires_auth`, `pending_missing_fields`, `resume_token`
3. `camera.snapshot`
   - expected signal: snapshot capture returns a media artifact only
   - watch fields: `storage.target`, `mime_type`, `byte_size`, `relative_path`
4. `camera.share_link`
   - legacy alias: `camera.live_view`
   - expected signal: share output is a signed link artifact, not a raw device URL
   - watch fields: `device_id`, `expires_at`, `scope`, `token_hash`
5. `camera.analyze`
   - expected signal: analysis returns text plus artifact references
   - watch fields: `analysis.text`, `artifacts[]`, `source`
6. `camera.record_clip` / `camera.recording_start`
   - expected signal: clip or rolling DVR capture returns media artifacts plus keyframe hints
   - watch fields: `clip_length_seconds`, `segment_seconds`, `stream_kind`, `storage.target`, `mime_type`, `byte_size`
7. `device.inspect`
   - expected signal: device inspection returns read-only device state and
     metadata without mutating ownership
   - watch fields: `device_id`, `discovery_source`, `room`, `vendor`, `model`
8. `device.control`
   - expected signal: device-native control remains in the device lane and does
     not collapse into HarborOS system control
   - watch fields: `device_id`, `control_mode`, `operation`, `result`

## Cutover Watchpoints

- keep device control inside the device domain
- keep device inspection read-only and device-owned
- keep stream storage and PTZ/control execution separate
- do not treat `route_key` as a device or media semantic
- do not treat `resume_token` as anything other than business-flow continuation
- do not widen HarborOS system control to absorb camera-native behavior

## Failure Signs

- scan discovers devices but connect cannot resume after password
- snapshot returns a control-path artifact or mutates registry state
- live view exposes raw device URLs instead of a share artifact
- analyze loses the device hint or drops the snapshot/media reference
- absence of `route_key` breaks legacy HarborBeacon payload construction

## Recommended Checks

- `python -m pytest tests/test_harborbeacon/test_bootstrap.py`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_harborbeacon/test_dispatcher.py`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_harborbeacon/test_task_api.py`
- `cargo test --lib discovery_service_delegates_snapshot_capture`
- `cargo test --lib snapshot_and_open_stream_keep_media_and_control_paths_separate`

## Closeout Proof Pack

Date: 2026-04-19

Boundary proof:

- `discover`, `snapshot`, `share_link`, `inspect`, and `control` stay owned by the Home Device Domain.
- Harbor Assistant's device page treats image, snapshot, still-frame, and DVR segment inputs as the first-version VLM surface.
- short clips and rolling DVR segments stay media artifacts with keyframe-derived retrieval evidence, not a separate continuous-video model stack.
- `camera.share_link` remains the canonical device-lane action; `camera.live_view` stays a compatibility alias only.
- `inspect` stays read-only and device-owned.
- `control` stays device-native and is not claimed by HarborOS executors or HarborOS system control.
- media capture and PTZ/control execution remain separated.
- retrieval evidence stays separate from runtime control.
- HarborOS does not own device control.

Current risk signals:

- discovery still depends on stable LAN reachability and device credential handoff.
- `connect` resume remains sensitive to password-prompt replay and `resume_token` reuse.
- share-link proof still needs to keep signed-link output distinct from raw device URLs.

Non-regression conclusion:

- This closeout confirms the camera canary remains device-native, keeps retrieval/control separation intact, and does not expand HarborOS system control ownership.
